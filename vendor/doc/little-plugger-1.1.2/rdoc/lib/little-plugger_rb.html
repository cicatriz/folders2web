      <h2>Description</h2>
      
<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<p><a href="../LittlePlugger.html">LittlePlugger</a> is a module that provides
Gem based plugin management. By extending your own class or module with <a
href="../LittlePlugger.html">LittlePlugger</a> you can easily manage the
loading and initializing of plugins provided by other gems.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Plugins are great! They allow other developers to add functionality to an
application but relieve the application developer of the responsibility for
mainting some other developer’s plugin code. <a
href="../LittlePlugger.html">LittlePlugger</a> aims to make it dead simple
to manage external plugins as gems.</p>

<h3>Naming</h3>

<p>Every plugin managed by <a href="../LittlePlugger.html">LittlePlugger</a>
will have a name represented as a Symbol. This name is used to register the
plugin, load the plugin file, and manage the plugin class/module. Here are
the three rules for plugin names:</p>

<p>1) all lowercase with underscores 2) maps to a file of the same name with
an ‘.rb’ extension 3) converting the name to camel case yields the plugin
class / module</p>

<p>These rules are essentially the standard ruby practice of naming files
after the class / module the file defines.</p>

<h3>Finding &amp; Loading</h3>

<p>Plugins are found by searching through the lib folders of all installed
gems; these gems are not necessarily loaded - just searched. If the lib
folder has a subdirectory that matches the <tt>plugin_path</tt>, then all
ruby files in the gem’s <tt>plugin_path</tt> are noted for later loading.</p>

<p>A file is only loaded if the basename of the file matches one of the
registered plugin names. If no plugins are registered, then every file in
the <tt>plugin_path</tt> is loaded.</p>

<p>The plugin classes / modules are all expected to live in the same namespace
for a particular application. For example, all plugins for the “Foo”
application should reside in a “Foo::Plugins” namespace. This allows the
plugins to be automatically initialized by <a
href="../LittlePlugger.html">LittlePlugger</a>.</p>

<h3>Initializing</h3>

<p>Optionally, plugins can provide an initialization method for running any
setup code needed by the plugin. This initialize method should be named as
follows: “initializer_#{plugin_name}” where the name of the plugin is
appended to the end of the initializer method name.</p>

<p>If this method exists, it will be called automatically when plugins are
loaded. The order of loading of initialization is not strictly defined, so
do not rely on another plugin being initialized for your own plugin
successfully initialize.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p><a href="../LittlePlugger.html">LittlePlugger</a> is used by extending your
own class or module with the <a
href="../LittlePlugger.html">LittlePlugger</a> module.</p>

<pre>module Logging
  extend LittlePlugger
end</pre>

<p>This defines a <tt>plugin_path</tt> and a <tt>plugin_module</tt> for our
Logging module. The <tt>plugin_path</tt> is set to “logging/plugins”, and
therefore, the <tt>plugin_modlue</tt> is defined as Logging::Plugins. All
plugins for the Logging module should be found underneath this plugin
module.</p>

<p>The plugins for the Logging module are loaded and initialized by calling
the <tt>initialize_plugins</tt> method.</p>

<pre>Logging.initialize_plugins</pre>

<p>If you only want to load the plugin files but not initialize the plugin
classes / modules then you can call the <tt>load_plugins</tt> method.</p>

<pre>Logging.load_plugins</pre>

<p>Finally, you can get a hash of all the loaded plugins.</p>

<pre>Logging.plugins</pre>

<p>This returns a hash keyed by the plugin names with the plugin class /
module as the value.</p>

<p>If you only want a certain set of plugins to be loaded, then pass the names
to the <tt>plugin</tt> method.</p>

<pre>Logging.plugin :foo, :bar, :baz</pre>

<p>Now only three plugins for the Logging module will be loaded.</p>

<h3>Customizing</h3>

<p><a href="../LittlePlugger.html">LittlePlugger</a> allows the use of a
custom plugin path and module. These are specified when extending with
LilttlePlugger by passing the specific path and module to <a
href="../LittlePlugger.html">LittlePlugger</a>.</p>

<pre>class Hoe
  extend LittlePlugger( :path =&gt; 'hoe', :module =&gt; Hoe )

  plugin(
      :clean, :debug, :deps, :flay, :flog, :package,
      :publish, :rcov, :signing, :test
  )
end</pre>

<p>All ruby files found under the “hoe” directory will be treated as plugins,
and the plugin classes / modules should reside directly under the Hoe
namespace.</p>

<p>We also specify a list of plugins to be loaded. Only these plugins will be
loaded and initialized by the <a
href="../LittlePlugger.html">LittlePlugger</a> module. The <tt>plugin</tt>
method can be called multiple times to add more plugins.</p>
